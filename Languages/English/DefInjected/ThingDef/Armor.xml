	<SSMkIII_StealthSuitMkIII.description>Full invisibility armor. Developed in ▇▇▇▇, by scientist ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇. Effective only for melee warriors, since the invisibility field is destroyed when using a long-shot weapon, disabling the invisibility equipment and rendering the suit unusable. It is also worth noting that damage by an electromagnetic pulse leads to an explosion. By wearing a suit, characters gain satisfaction in communicating with AI, but thereby lose not only in work efficiency but also in gaining skills.</SSMkIII_StealthSuitMkIII.description>
